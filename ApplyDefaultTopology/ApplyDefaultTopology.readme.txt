#
# Purpose: This script will create a topology element and apply generic topology rules to each feature class.
#		Generic Topology Rules that are applied:
#			Polygons:  
#				   Must not overlap
#				   Must not have gaps
#				   Must be covered by feature class of (applied if Boundary Polygon argument is used)
#			Lines:	   
#				   Must not have pseudonodes
#				   Must not self intersect
#				   Must not self overlap
#				   Must be inside (applied if Boundary Polygon argument is used)
#			Points:
#				   Must be properly inside polygons (applied if Boundary Polygon argument is used)
#
# Created on: October 2008
# Updated April 2009:  Corrected rules for lines and points overlapping with project boundary.
# Updated November 2012:  Dana Diotte updated for ArcGIS 10.0
#
# Usage: ApplyDefaultTopology.py <Feature_Dataset><Topology_Name><Feature_Class{;Feature_Class}...>{Cluster_Tolerance}{Boundary_Polygon}{Validate}
# Arguments:
#	Feature_Dataset - Feature Dataset to create the topology element in (and where the Feature Classes to apply topology to reside)
#	Topology_Name	- Name of the topology element
#	Feature_Class(es) - Feature Class or Feature Classes to apply topology to.  
#				When multiple feature classes are selected separate feature classes by a semi colon.
#				When multiple feature classes are selected, their RANK is determined by their order.
#	Cluster_Tolerance - Will default to the XY tolerance of the feature dataset in Meters. 
#	Boundary_Polygon - The boundary to make sure features are within.
#	Validate	- Boolean variable.  When populated the topology will be validated.
#
# Outputs:
#	A topology element set up according to parameters
#
# Dependencies (Deprecated):
#	This tool requires that the 'AddRuleToTopologyModel' model exist within the 'ApplyDefaultTopology.tbx 
#	toolbox in the same directory as the source python code for this script tool.  
#	This model runs the 'Add Rule To Topology' tool.  It is called as a work around to correct 
#	a known error (in 9.2 and 9.3) preventing the tool from running when called through a script tool.  
#	
#
# History:
#	November 8, 2012
#	~ Updated script to use arcpy for ArcGIS 10+
#	~ Added alias 'defaultTopo' to stand alone toolbox in order for the new ImportToolbox to work (Deprecated)
#	~ Updated script to use arcpy for ArcGIS 10+
#   	~ added new topology rule for lines "must be inside"
#   	~ removed custom model as it is not necessary in ArcGIS 10 (SP5) and higher
#   	~ The "obtained from" was available in 9.2 (it was called Dependency) for FeatureLayer but has been removed 
#       in the supported type at 9.3/10.x. It was found the this this scripts parameters for "Participating
#       Feature Class" and subsequently removed.
